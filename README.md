KrishiSense: A Multi-Model Risk Assessment Framework for Agricultural Planning

Tagline: AI-Powered Asset Intelligence Platform for Precision Agriculture.

1. Overview

Indian agriculture operates in a high-risk environment characterized by climatic volatility and market opacity. KrishiSense is a data-driven Risk Management Engine that treats crops as financial assets. By aggregating historical meteorological, agronomic, and economic data (2015-2023), it quantifies structural risks to provide strategic decision support for Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) and policy-makers.

2. The Solution: The Risk Trinity

The framework integrates three distinct predictive modules to address specific agricultural risks:

Climate Risk Module (Unsupervised Learning): Uses Hierarchical Clustering to group districts into "Agro-Climatic Zones" based on weather patterns and yield stability.

Agronomic Risk Module (Supervised Regression): Uses Polynomial Regression to model the non-linear "Goldilocks Zone" of rainfall impact on crop yields (specifically Sugarcane).

Market Risk Module (Deep Learning): Uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to forecast short-term price trends for volatile crops like Onion.
